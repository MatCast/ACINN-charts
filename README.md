#ACINN Charts
This repository uses data from [Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences (ACINN)](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/) of Innsbruck University to plot weather data.

It is a reproduction of what was already available on the ACINN website and is now hosted [here](http://meteo145.uibk.ac.at/current-weather/innsbruck-university).

The aim of this repository is to recreate more or less the same charts with open source software, and to make it as easy as possible to maintain.

It uses [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to create the charts
